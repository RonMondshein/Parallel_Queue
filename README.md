# Parallel Queue

This repository houses the implementation of a concurrent FIFO queue in C, designed to support enqueue and dequeue operations using threads. 

The queue is engineered to be thread-safe, guaranteeing that dequeue operations are distributed to sleeping threads in FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order.
